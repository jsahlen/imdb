IMDb Parser
===========

Built this as a learning excercise, and because the existing libraries didn't work exactly as I wanted them to.

This is an extremely early version, which will likely be severely refactored as it progresses.

Search example
--------------

This is the only functionality that works right now.

    require 'imdb'
    require 'pp' # just for printing

    results = IMDB::Search.new("howl")
    results.each do |movie|
      pp movie # IMDB::Movie object
    end
