IMDb Parser
===========

Built this as a learning excercise, and because the existing libraries didn't work exactly as I wanted them to.

This is an extremely early version, which will likely be severely refactored as it progresses.

Example: Search
---------------

    #!/usr/bin/ruby

    require 'imdb'

    results = IMDB::Search.new("howl")
    results.each do |m|
      pp m
    end
